# ðŸš† Rails Way App <!-- omit in toc -->

_**Eighteen versions**_ (gradually implemented) of a Web and REST API app made with [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) that aims to get the most out of the `MVC`/`Rails Way`.

The `Current` class had two responsibilities: containing thread-safe shared state and queries to authorize user access.

This branch separates these responsibilities, keeping the primary scope of the `Current` class (containing thread-safe and shareable state) but moving the authorization responsibility to the `Account::Member` and `Account::Member::Authorization` POROS (Plain Old Ruby Objects).

POROS means a model that doesn't inherit from `ActiveRecord`, and it's a common pattern to extract complex logic from `ActiveRecord` models.

### ðŸ¤” Why this change matter? <!-- omit in toc -->

Cohesion + Separation of Concerns = Better understanding, maintainability and testability.

### ðŸ”Ž What the next version will have? <!-- omit in toc -->

In the next version, we will enrich the application's domain model, starting with the Current class, which contains different responsibilities and a higher level of complexity.

`Next version`: [061-domain-model_user-token-poro](https://github.com/solid-process/rails-way-app/tree/061-domain-model_user-token-poro?tab=readme-ov-file).
