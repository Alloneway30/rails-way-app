### ðŸ¤” Why does consistency matter? <!-- omit in toc -->

> Conceptual Integrity:
> In 1975, FredBrooks said: I will contend that Conceptual Integrity is the most important consideration in system design. It _**is better**_ to have a system omit certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, _**than**_ to have one that contains many good but independent and uncoordinated ideas.

Consistency is a key factor in the maintainability of a system. It makes it easier to understand and as a consequence, easier to maintain (promote changes).

This is applicable to everything in the system, from the code to the user interface.

This applies to everything in the system, from the code to the user interface. This branch was added to add this concept to the spotlight.

### ðŸ”Ž What the next version will have? <!-- omit in toc -->

Aiming to improve the application consistency, the following version groups some models within namespaces.

`Next version`: [040-models-within-namespaces](https://github.com/solid-process/rails-way-app/tree/040-models-within-namespaces?tab=readme-ov-file).
